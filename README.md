# K-Means Clustering Assignment
This assignment is based on a customer dataset that includes the following features:
* Customer ID
* Age
* Gender
* Annual Income (k$)
* Spending Score (1-100)

Spending Score is a value assigned to customers based on parameters such as their behavior and purchasing data. The dataset and a description can be found at the following link:[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/data)

**Task Description**

You are required to perform a clustering analysis on this dataset using K-Means-based
methods. Specifically, you will:
1. Implement the basic K-Means algorithm with simple cluster initialization.
2. Implement the K-Means++ algorithm.
3. Compare basic K-Means and K-Means++ based on the number of iterations required
to reach convergence.
4. Explore another initialization method for the number of clusters that you will
compare with the two previous.
5. Explore/Implement the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
